Plugin for [LLM](https://llm.datasette.io/) adding support for the [GPT4All](https://gpt4all.io/) collection of models.

## Installation

Install this plugin in the same environment as LLM.

## Usage

### Model Installation and Prompting

You can execute a model using the name displayed in the `llm models list` output. The model file will be downloaded the first time you attempt to run it.

```bash
llm -m orca-mini-3b-gguf2-q4_0 '3 names for a pet cow'
```
The first time you run this you will see a progress bar for the model file download:
```
 31%|█████████▋                        | 1.16G/3.79G [00:26<01:02, 42.0MiB/s]
```
On subsequent uses the model output will be displayed immediately.

Note that the models will be downloaded to `~/.cache/gpt4all`.

### Model options

Run `llm models --options` for a list of available model options, which should include:

```
gpt4all: mistral-7b-instruct-v0 - Mistral Instruct, 3.83GB download, needs 8GB RAM (installed)
  max_tokens: int
    The maximum number of tokens to generate.
  temp: float
    The model temperature. Larger values increase creativity but decrease
    factuality.
  top_k: int
    Randomly sample from the top_k most likely tokens at each generation
    step. Set this to 1 for greedy decoding.
  top_p: float
    Randomly sample at each generation step from the top most likely
    tokens whose probabilities add up to top_p.
  repeat_penalty: float
    Penalize the model for repetition. Higher values result in less
    repetition.
  repeat_last_n: int
    How far in the models generation history to apply the repeat penalty.
  n_batch: int
    Number of prompt tokens processed in parallel. Larger values decrease
    latency but increase resource requirements.
```
Use them like this:

```bash
llm -m mistral-7b-instruct-v0 -o max_tokens 2 'hi'
```
```
Hello!
```

### Chatting

To chat with a model, avoiding the need to load it into memory for every message, use `llm chat`:

```bash
llm chat -m orca-mini-3b-gguf2-q4_0
```
```
Chatting with orca-mini-3b-gguf2-q4_0
Type 'exit' or 'quit' to exit
Type '!multi' to enter multiple lines, then '!end' to finish
> hi
 Hello! How can I assist you today?
> three jokes about a pelican and a chicken who are friends
 Sure, here are three jokes about a pelican and a chicken who are friends:

1. Why did the pelican cross the road? To get to the other side where the chicken was waiting for him!
2. What do you call a group of chickens playing basketball? A flock of feathers!
3. Why did the chicken invite the pelican over for dinner? Because it had nothing else to eat and needed some extra protein in its diet!
```

### Removing Models

To remove a downloaded model, delete the `.gguf` file from `~/.cache/gpt4all`.
